# Networkprogramming with Sockets in C

This is just a learning project or rather code snippets for learning.
Main goal is to learn the basics about Windows Sockets as well as
Barkley Sockets for UNIX like systems.
Therefore source code is written in a cross-compileable manner.

I'm using gcc on Linux and MingW gcc on Windows for compiling.
